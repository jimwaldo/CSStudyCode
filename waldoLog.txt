Added buildAnonList14.py, which will anonymize the data set sent by the registrar covering academic years 14-15 and 15-16.
This set is pretty much the same as the last one, with additional fields for a secondary instructor (which is not being
transferred to the anonymized set) and fields for level of financial aid and percentage of total costs covered by
financial aid. These last two fields are added to the end of each row. Random ids are generated once again, with students
who had random ids generated for the earlier set getting the same random id this time around.

Tracking down why the students listed in CS_Concentrators_Anon.csv and ConcentratorInfoAnon.csv are not the same.

CS_Concentrators_Anon.csv was generated from CS Concentrators Fall 2005 to Present 2015-07-12.csv, using buildAnonConc.py.
ConcentratorInfoAnon.csv was generated from ConcentratorInfoOriginal.csv, using anonConcInfo.py.

CS Concentrators Fall... contains information for students from 2005 to the present; ConcentratorInfo contains students
from 2009 to the present. Need to check that students in CS Concentrators but not in ConcentratorInfo are all students
before 2009.

All of the students who appear in CS Concentrators Fall... but not in ConcentatorInfo fall into one of two categories:
    1) The student graduated prior to 2009, and so wasn't included in the range of students for ConcentratorsInfo
    2) The student had a joint concentration, with the non-CS concentration listed first. These students were not included
        in the query that created the ConcentratorInfo file.

All of the students who appear in the ConcentratorInfo file but not the CS Concentrators file fall into one of two categories:
    1) They were CS concentrators at one point, but changed their concentration to something else before graduation, or
    2) The only information about the students are that they are CS concentrators; nothing else is supplied, including
        the date that they declared their concentration. There are only three of these students; I would bet that they
        are either FERPA blocked (in which case they probably shouldn't have shown up at all) or on leave or have some
        other reason to not appear much.
